    <p><strong>Full Name:</strong> Park Jimin</p>
    <p><strong>Position:</strong> main dancer, lead vocalist</p>
    <p><strong>Birthdate:</strong> October 13, 1995</p>
    <p>Jimin made his debut in June 2013 as BTS's main dancer and lead vocalist with the single album "2 Cool 4 Skool." Originally a hip-hop group, it was not until 2016 that they began expanding their music to incorporate more genres. Their second studio album, "Wings," became the first to sell one million copies in South Korea, and the following year, they began paving the way for K-pop in the United States by receiving a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for their single "Mic Drop".</p>
